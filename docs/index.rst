ERPpeek's documentation
=======================

*A versatile tool for browsing OpenERP data*

The ERPpeek library communicates with any `OpenERP server
<http://doc.openerp.com/>`_ using the standard XML-RPC interface.
It provides both a :ref:`fully featured low-level API <client-and-services>`,
and an encapsulation of the methods on :ref:`Active Record objects
<model-and-records>`.  Additional helpers are provided to explore the model
and administrate the server remotely.
